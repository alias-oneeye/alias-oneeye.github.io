As you know, in real life, my name is not really Alias One-Eye.

The name is part joke, and part reference to a favorite series of novels.

<!--
The joke is about this article:

[Alias and Savvy? Random Words are the New Trend in Baby Names](http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/alias-savvy-random-words-trend-baby-names/story?id=33133981)

More specifically, it is about my stance that it's none of your business what someone named their kid.

The series is Glen Cook's *The Black Company*.
