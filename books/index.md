title: On Books

I don't pretend to be either a scholar of literature or a
connaisseur. I've created this section as a way for me to keep track
of my own findings as I read and research books that I'm interested
in.

These things may be useful to someone else, but they may also be
misleading: while I hope to be correct in everything I write,
most of what I've said here has not been researched throughly.
If you find errors, disagree, or just want to share your thoughts,
please do email me at the address shown at the bottom of the page.
