## English translations

*   Though it is not quite up to date (Powell is missing), this
    Amazon list gives lines 8-11 of the poem from many different
    translations:
    [Virgil's Aeneid: Twenty Eight Translations
    ](http://www.amazon.com/lm/RZ6I7YVLPKCK1)

*   The translations that I am most familiar with right now are:

    *   Powell, 2015
    *   Fagles, 2006
    *   Lombardo, 2005
    *   Fitzgerald, 1983
    *   Mandelbaum, 1971
    *   Fairclough, 1916
    *   Conington, 1867
    *   Dryden, 1700

## Latin editions

*   Fairclough and Brown, *Virgil's Aeneid, Books I-VI, with
    introduction, notes, and vocabulary*

    The 1919 edition has macra in the text.

*   Conington, *P. Vergili Maronis Opera, with a Commentary*

    In three volumes, this work contains a Latin edition of Virgil's
    works along with a running commentary in footnotes. The commentary
    takes up more space than the text on many pages.

*   Johnston and Ganiban

*   Clyde Pharr

*   Giles Laur√©n

    Among other good points, I've found that LongOblivion uses very
    robust packaging.
