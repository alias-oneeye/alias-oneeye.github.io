title: Public Domain Books
---

In recent years, many wonderful old documents have been scanned and
made available for public use. They are out there, but there is little
information about where to find them or which ones are worth looking
at. Here I've attempted to make a small catalog of some of those
useful old books.

With most of these books, in order to use them you'll have to download
the PDF version and either print it out or read it on a screen. There
are text versions, but most were machine-generated with no
proofreading, and they are so full of errors as to be useless. There
are also raw images of the scanned pages, but these are unlikely to be
more useful than the PDFs for most purposes. Also, many of the books
themselves had handwritten notes or damage that mars or even
obfuscates the text.

My hope is that, with these resources available, the best of them will
be re-done and made available in cleaner, more useful forms, and that
this work will also be released into the public domain.

Note that some people have done this kind of cleanup and claimed a
copyright on the resulting document. Such a copyright is probably
false, since minor changes to a work do not entitle the editor to
claim a new copyright. My understanding is that it is a federal
criminal offense in the United States to falsely claim copyright, but
it is commonly done anyway, and such offenders are very unlikely to
ever face any consequences for doing so.

Rather than ignoring such illegal copyright claims and copying the
work anyway (as it is your legal right to do, since the work is still
in the public domain), I think it better that people produce new
editions from the originals that are uncontestably in the public
domain, with a clear, free license (i.e. <span markdown='1'
class='fixed'>[CC0](
https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)</span>) for any
original accompanying material, and expressly make the products
available to the public.

**Note:** In some cases, I have provided a link to a more recent,
in-print edition of a work. In most cases, I haven't actually seen the
newer edition, although I do try to determine whether I think it
would be worthwhile to have (in particular, that is not a third-rate
copy that is full of errors or physically falls apart). In some cases,
I will get some money should you choose to buy one of the books
through my link. I try not to consider this last fact when adding the
links, however. My goal here is to introduce you to free works, not to
convince you to spend your money. In some cases, though, the newer
book is either a clear improvement on older books, or it's cheap
enough that if you want a paper copy you might as well buy it instead
of printing it out yourself (Dover editions typically fall into this
latter class).

    *   [Greenough D'Ooge Daniell 1898, *Caesar's Gallic War*](
        https://archive.org/details/comedyofmerchant00shakuoft):
        A re-edition of Allen and Greenough's *Caesar*. Contains
        English-language introduction and paragraph headings, plus
        notes and vocabulary at the end.

        war: literally translated, with explanatory notes*](
        https://archive.org/details/caesarscommentar00caes
        ): This appears to be intended as an aid to students
        attempting to read Caesar's *Gallic War* in Latin; as I
        understand it, such books were considered to serve a purpose
        much like today's Cliffs Notes, and many professors frowned
        upon their use.
