title: On Language
---

In the realm of language, I actually do have some scholarly
credentials, although since I'm not a practicing academic and I no
longer work in a language-related field, my knowledge in the field has
atrophied significantly. Nonetheless, I do have considerable
experience studying both languages and linguistics, so some things I
offer here may be of some use to people.

## Linguistics

## Philippine languages

* Carl Rubino
* Precy Espiritu

## Latin and Greek

1.  Online resources

    *   [Dickson College Commentaries](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/)

        This site contains two main things of interest:

        *   *"Latin and Greek texts for reading, with explanatory
            notes, vocabulary, and graphic, video, and audio
            elements."* (Currently there are only Latin texts, but this
            suggests that they intend to add Greek texts in the
            future.)

        *   Vocabulary lists of the most common Latin and Greek words,
            organized in several formats for consumption by either
            human or computer.

    *   [The Perseus Digital Library ("Perseus Hopper")](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/)

        Digitized, searchable versions of a large number of Latin and
        Greek works, including Homer and Virgil. Words in these texts
        are linked to a words database that gives you definitions and
        references to uses of the word in other texts.

1.  My Homer and Vergil pages.

1.  Perseus project.

1.  Public domain resources.

1.  Textbooks, grammars, dictionaries, etc.
